- I changed the send message into a button with a type of submit and a cursor: pointer.

### Member 4 (Olaniyi Olufemi)

- I worked on making the input and send message button send the text into the chat box using java, html and css
- i had to comment out the previous html as most of it was more of a place holder text

- BUGS i noticed after git clone

a The search bar seems to be positioned in the wrong place
b The chat section does not have to scroll with the entire page only the contact section should scroll

### Member 1 (Stanley Azi) update 2

#### Bugs fixed

- search bar
- responsiveness
- scroll bar added
- debugged a lot of codes...Almost the entire application
- fixed deployment, meaning you can deploy to vercel or netlify without issues
- mades lots of edits of unused styles
- For now, do not touch responsiveness as it is perfect ATM

#### What I think is left is this stage 1

- On mobile version, the chat box is hidden. It is intended to be opened and cover the entire screen when I new chat is clicked. and it should be able to display the correct chat box for each user message.
- On desktop view, user whose message was opened in the chat box, should be able to have a different color to indicate active among the lists of Messages in section 1
- Kindly update this READ with what you think is left or what you noticed.

#### Notes

- try as much as you can to not repeat styles on media queries, if a style is applied in the global, it should not be repeated in media querries...thus, apply only styles you need to change in the media queries while it inherits other styles from the global which is the parent style
- try to give your classes or ids unique names or make sure to take note of specificity when using CSS. two classes clashed in the two sections (.messages) which the style on one was controlling the other. Fixed tho
- to enhance specificity or avoid clashing of classes, chaining from parent class until the child class can be good, using css nexting would be great. e.g

1
.icon-1, .icon-2 {
width: max-content;
height: max-content;

& img {
width: 1.5rem;
height: 1.5rem;
border-radius: unset;
}
}

2
.profile-box .profile-img {
display: block;
width: 36px !important;
height: 36px;
border-radius: 50%;
}

in the above, 1 is applying style to `.icon-1` and `.icon-2` and the same time, this reduces repeating of styles, and also it used css nesting which makes it look clean and easy to debug. 2 used chaining to increase specificity. `.profile-box .profile-img` means style the profile img that is a child/decendant of profile box... this can help in style clashing in a case where two different components have the same class name.
